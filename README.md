# Retrocade theme for EmulationStation

For my personal Bartop project i use [Retropie](https://retropie.org.uk/) to play al my games. RetroPie allows you to turn your Raspberry Pi or PC into a retro-gaming machine. It builds upon Raspbian, [EmulationStation](http://www.emulationstation.org/index.html), RetroArch and many other projects to enable you to play your favourite Arcade, home-console, and classic PC games with the minimum set-up.

This theme is used to style EmulationStation which is used as the gui for Retropie.
